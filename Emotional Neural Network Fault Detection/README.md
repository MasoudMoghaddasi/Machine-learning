# Fault Detection using an Emotional Neural Network for the DAMADICS Benchmark
In this project, database fault detection consisting of feature extraction and classification is performed. 
Train data was obtained from DAMADICS benchmark. The classification method was based on an emotional neural network
called DuoNN. DuoNN first introduced by Dr. Adnan Khashman to recognize human faces. This type of neural network
was proposed considering human anxiety and confidence.
