In this repository several examples of classical ML solutions in different arias mostly in the field of fault detection and isolation are provided. These solutions consists of feature extraction (PCA, LDA, NPCA, DPCA, etc.), classification (SVM, KNN, Parzen, MLP, RBF, PNN, etc.), and clustering (K-means, C-means, FC-means, etc.) methods. In most of them the libraries are not used and the algorithm is written from the scratch.
